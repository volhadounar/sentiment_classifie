    I built this sentiment classifier as part of the Coursera course ''.

    The code analyses synthetic semi-randomly generated twitter data in a csv file
named project_twitter_data.csv, which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of a tweet,
and the number of replies to that tweet. 

    My sentiment classifier detect how positive or negative each tweet is. I created a csv file,
which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score
(which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet),
and the Net Score for each tweet.

    At the end, I uploaded the csv file to Excel and produced a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.
(a scatterplot of the Number of Retweets)
